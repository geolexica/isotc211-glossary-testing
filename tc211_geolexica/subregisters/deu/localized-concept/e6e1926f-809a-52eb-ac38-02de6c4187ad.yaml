          notes:
          - Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
            have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot be mapped to R2 in their entirety,
            but around each point position, a small neighbourhood can be found that
            resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle
            in R2, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this International Standard,
            most surface patches (instances of GM_SurfacePatch) are mapped to portions
            of R2 by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
