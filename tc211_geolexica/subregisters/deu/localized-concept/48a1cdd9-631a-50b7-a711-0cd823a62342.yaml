          notes:
          - The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into
            consideration constraints on the "curve" joining the two data points (time1,
            value1) and (time2, value2), looking at the value as a function of time.
            For example, if the continuous change is for the motion of a vehicle,
            then the constraints of physics and of the paths appropriate for that
            vehicle must be taken into consideration.
