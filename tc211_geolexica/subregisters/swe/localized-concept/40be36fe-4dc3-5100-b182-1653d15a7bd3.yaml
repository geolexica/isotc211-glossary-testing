          notes:
          - There is little logical difference between traveller and target except
            that the former is normally used for a moving object which is being tracked,
            and the latter is used for either an object that is not moving, or an
            object for which a location is needed only once. A traveller is the subject
            of a tracking service; a target is the subject of a locating service.
            Since this International Standard does not make a distinction between
            the protocols for these logically similar services, but does need to differentiate
            between the two concepts, both terms will be used as appropriate to the
            underlying semantics of the situation. Since all of these terms refer
            to entities represented by objects within the system, they can be combined
            with adjectives defined for objects. So, an active target (a target represented
            by an active object) can be used to represent a moving object, since the
            act of motion is modifying the target's internal state and is therefore
            initiating actions.
