          notes:
          - Since the definitions of geometric complex and topological complex require
            only that they be closed under boundary operations, the set of any primitives
            of a particular dimension and below is always a subcomplex of the original,
            larger complex. Thus, any full planar topological complex contains an
            edge-node graph as a subcomplex.
