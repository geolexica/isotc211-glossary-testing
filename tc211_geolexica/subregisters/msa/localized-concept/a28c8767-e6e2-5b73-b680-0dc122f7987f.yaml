          notes:
          - Compare with integration. While the conceptual schema of the information
            transferred shall be agreed upon to some level, coupling applications
            can be and are usually flexible in the data representation of that information
            as long as the semantics content is correct and mappable to some canonical
            representation of the conceptual schema. The most common mapping technology
            used for XML messages is XSLT, and the transformation stylesheet can be
            supplied either by the service broker or by the service provider. It is
            considered a best practice for a service provider to supply his functionality
            through several logically equivalent messaging APIs, each represented
            by a different URI linked to an XSLT transformation bridge, and implemented
            by the same internal code.
          - Loose coupling and tight coupling are not at present well-defined terms
            in the literature. Generally, "tight" coupling means that there is some
            sort of incurred dependency between requester and responder in the use
            of the interface, while "loose" means no such dependency. The nature of
            that dependency is not consistently defined between authors.  In that
            light, "tight" coupling or "tight" integration are both bad practices,
            and have been viewed as such since the inception of the terms. Some literature
            refers to integration as "tight coupling", but that is a less accurate
            description.
