          - The feature concept "road" may be used to specify several different feature
            types, each with a different set of properties appropriate for a particular
            application.  For a travel planning application, it might have a limited
            set of attributes such as name, route number, location and number of lanes,
            while for a maintenance application it might have an extensive set of
            attributes detailing the structure and composition of each of the layers
            of material for which it is composed.
