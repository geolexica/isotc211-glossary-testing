          notes:
          - The free variables mentioned above can usually be thought of as a local
            coordinate system. In a 3D coordinate space, a plane can be written as
            P(u, v) = A + u X + v Y, where u and v are real numbers and A is any point
            on the plane, and X and Y are two vectors tangent to the plane. Since
            the locations on the plane can be distinguished by u and v (here universally),
            the plane is 2D and (u, v) is a coordinate system for the points on the
            plane. On generic surfaces, this cannot, in general, be done universally.
            If we take a plane tangent to the surface, and project points on the surface
            onto this plane, we will normally get a local  isomorphism for small neighbourhoods
            of the point of tangency. This "local coordinate" system for the underlying
            surface is sufficient to establish the surface as a 2D topological object.
            Since this International Standard deals only with spatial coordinates,
            any 3D object can rely on coordinates to establish its topological dimension.
            In a 4D model (spatio-temporal), tangent spaces also play an important
            role in establishing topological dimension for objects up to 3D.
