          definition: containing all points on a "line" joining two interior points

          notes:
          - The definition of convex requires a definition of line. For coordinate
            systems, this is the usual linear interpolated arc, but in context, the
            "line" on a geometric reference surface will be a "geodesic arc". The
            default in this document is the linear interpolate.
