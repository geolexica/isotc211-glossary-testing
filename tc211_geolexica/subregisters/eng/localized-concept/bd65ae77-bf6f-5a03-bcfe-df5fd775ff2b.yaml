          notes:
          - The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of constant
            latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin (corresponding
            to the point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the exponential map
            on the geometric reference surface centred on the point of tangency.
