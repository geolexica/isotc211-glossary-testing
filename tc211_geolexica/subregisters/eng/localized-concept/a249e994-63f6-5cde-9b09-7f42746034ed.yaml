          notes:
          - Sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Since any two
            empty sets would share exactly the same contained elements (by definition
            none), they are, by definition, equal. The empty set (∅) can be considered
            a geometric entity, because all the elements it contains are points. This
            is a vacuous statement since the set ∅ contains no elements, and therefore
            the "for all" statement has nothing to test and is thus true in each of
            its non-existent cases. There are a lot of true but vacuous statements
            in proofs about ∅. This confuses some programmers since many systems use
            type safe sets, in which the class of the entities determines a class
            for the container set. The math does not care about "class" and only sees
            sets; so that an empty set of aardvarks and an empty set of zebras in
            mathematics are (is?) the same set. The other confusion is that ∅ is not
            the database Null introduced by Codd and used in relational and other
            query languages in 3 valued logic. Null means unknown and many statements
            involving Null are undecidable (neither provably true nor provably false).
            The empty set is not "lack of knowledge" but certainty in the nonexistence
            of elements in the set. Most statements beginning "for all elements in
            ∅" are true, but vacuous. Most statements beginning "there exist an element
            in ∅" are always categorically false. It is almost impossible to construct
            an undecidable statement about ∅. Null and ∅ are not related. "Void" can
            mean "invalid" or "completely empty."
