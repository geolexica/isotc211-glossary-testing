          definition: general lowering in level of a moving vessel, relative to what
            its level would be were it motionless, due to the regional depression
            of the surface of the water in which the ship moves

          notes:
          - Settlement is not an increase in displacement.
          - Settlement is measured as an angular tilt about the centre of gravity
            of the vessel.
