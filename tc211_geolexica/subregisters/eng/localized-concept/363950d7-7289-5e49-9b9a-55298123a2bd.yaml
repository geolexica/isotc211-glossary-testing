          definition: problem that given a point on a surface and the direction and
            distance from that point to a second point along a geodesic, determines
            that second point

          notes:
          - This "problem" defines a mapping from the vector space at a point (each
            vector given by a direction and a length) to points of the Figure of Earth
            that satisfy the problem for that direction and distance. For example,
            if we fix the distance "r" and take all directions, the resultant geometry
            is the circle centred at the original point of radius "r". This document
            will make heavy use of this mapping; see exponential map and the second
            geodetic problem.
