          notes:
          - May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of
            the geographic coordinate reference system from which it is derived.
          - In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic latitude
            and geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and easting
            and the ellipsoidal height is unchanged.
