          notes:
          - Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information
            about geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces,
            and solids. Many geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting
            the same interfaces defined for geometric primitives) but are actually
            composites composed of some number of other primitives. General collections
            may be aggregates and incapable of acting like a primitive (such as the
            lines of a complex network, which is not connected and thus incapable
            of being traceable as a single line). By this definition, a geometric
            primitive is topological open, since the boundary points are not isotropic
            to the interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For points,
            the boundary is empty.
