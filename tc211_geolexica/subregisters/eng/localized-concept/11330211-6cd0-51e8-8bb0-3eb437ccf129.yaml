          definition: measure of the pairs of values of an attribute type that assigns
            a numeric value that is positive, symmetric, and satisfies the triangular
            inequality

          notes:
          - A measure "d" is positive if d(x, y) > 0 for every x, y where x/=y and
            d(x,x) = 0. A measure "d" is symmetric if d(x, y) = d(y, x)  for every
            x, y. A measure "d" satisfies the triangular inequality if d(x, y) <=
            d(x, a) + d(a, y) for every a, x and y. All numeric or vector valued attributes
            have such a metric, the most common being the Euclidean metric based on
            the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each dimension.
            Other non-Euclidean metrics take "curvature of space" into account (such
            as along the surface of the spheroid).
