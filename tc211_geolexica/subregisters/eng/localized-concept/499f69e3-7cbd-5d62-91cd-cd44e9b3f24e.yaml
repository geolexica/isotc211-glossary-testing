          definition: coordinate operation in which both coordinate reference systems
            are based on the same datum
          entry_status: superseded
          examples:
          - Conversion from an ellipsoidal coordinate reference system based on the
            WGS84 datum to a Cartesian coordinate reference system also based on the
            WGS84 datum, or change of units such as from radians to degrees or feet
            to metres.

          notes:
          - A coordinate conversion uses parameters which have specified values that
            are not determined empirically.
