          notes:
          - By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize
            the target more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives
            orthogonal (e.g. horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates
            four polarizations of a single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol
            SAR is addressed in this document.
