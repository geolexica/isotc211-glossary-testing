          - '"A Euclidean space with a spatial dimension of 3, ùîº3, usually uses axis
            names ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', Its first spatial dimension is ''x'', its
            second is ''y'' and its third is ''z''." In the context of the space,
            the adjective use describes the space but the singular noun can use a
            name for an axis separately.'
