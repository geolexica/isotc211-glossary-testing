          notes:
          - The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating the
            power of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLRis expressed
            as  `ISLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(total))-P_(text(main)))/(P_(text(main)))}`
            where  `P_(text(total))` is the total power, `P_(text(main))` is the main
            lobe power.
          - The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width
            (IRW), centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually
            between 2 and 2,5.
