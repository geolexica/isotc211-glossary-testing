          notes:
          - In most cases, the vertical datum will be related to mean sea level. Ellipsoidal
            heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate
            system referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical datums include sounding
            datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may
            be negative heights or depths.
