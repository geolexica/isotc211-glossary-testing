          - In this document an attribute is an XML attribute unless otherwise specified.
            The syntax of an XML attribute is  "Attribute::= Name = AttValue". An
            attribute typically acts as an XML element modifier (e.g.  <Road gml:id
            = "r1" />; here gml:id is an attribute.
