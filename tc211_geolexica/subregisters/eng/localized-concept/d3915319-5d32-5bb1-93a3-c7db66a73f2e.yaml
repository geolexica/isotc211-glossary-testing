          notes:
          - Typically for LIDAR, sufficient calibration has not been done to calculate
            absolute intensity, so relative intensity is usually reported.  In linear
            mode systems, this value is typically provided as an integer, resulting
            from a mapping of the return’s signal power to an integer value via a
            lookup table.
