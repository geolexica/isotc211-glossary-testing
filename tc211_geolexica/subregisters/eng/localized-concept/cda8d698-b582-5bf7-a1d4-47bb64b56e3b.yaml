          definition: reduction of the number of data elements, bandwidth, cost, and
            time for the generation, transmission, and storage of data without loss
            of information by eliminating unnecessary redundancy, removing irrelevancy,
            or using special coding

          notes:
          - Whereas data compaction reduces the amount of data used to represent a
            given amount of information, data compression does not.
          - Data compaction can be done through aggregation of like values in adjacent
            grid cells, tiling schemes or other means of eliminating information that
            is not relevant.
