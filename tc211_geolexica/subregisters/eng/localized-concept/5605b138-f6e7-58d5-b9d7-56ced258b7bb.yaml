          notes:
          - In a metric space, a set `X` us open if each point `x` in the set is contained
            in some small ball which is a subset of \(X:\) \([X \text{ is open}] \Leftrightarrow
            [x \in X] \implies [\exists \varepsilon > 0 \backepsilon \text{distance}
            (x,y) < \varepsilon] \implies [y \in X]\). A topology is a set of subsets
            of a space which are considered open.
