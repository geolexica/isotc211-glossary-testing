          notes:
          - Scattering matrix is defined via `((E_H^s),(E_V^s)) = e^(jkR)/R ([S_(HH),S_(HV)],
            [S_(VH), S_(VV)])((E_H^j), (E_V^j))` where `([S_(HH),S_(HV)], [S_(VH),
            S_(VV)])` is the scattering matrix; `((E_H^j), (E_V^j))` is the electronic
            field vector of the wave incident on the scatterer; `((E_H^s), (E_V^s))`
            is the electronic field vector of the scattered wave; `k` is the wavenumber
            of the illuminating wave; `R` is the distance between the target and the
            radar antenna.
