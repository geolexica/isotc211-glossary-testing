          definition: realization of a terrestrial reference system (TRS), by specifying
            its origin, orientation, scale, and its time evolution

          notes:
          - The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with precisely
            determined coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which may include
            the rate of coordinate change.
          - The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are
            defined, and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without
            considering the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization
            may be called dynamic when these external forces are considered. "Dynamic"
            is also used colloquially to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases
            without distinction.
