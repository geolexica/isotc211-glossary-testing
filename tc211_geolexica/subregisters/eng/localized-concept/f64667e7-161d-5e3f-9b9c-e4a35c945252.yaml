          notes:
          - A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a transitive
            agency between the agent of the first link and the principal of the last.
            This chain can be spoken of in either direction, either as “principal
            -> agent = principal -> agent” (normal or granting order) or “agent ->
            principal = agent -> principal” (reverse, acceptance, verification or
            tracing order).
