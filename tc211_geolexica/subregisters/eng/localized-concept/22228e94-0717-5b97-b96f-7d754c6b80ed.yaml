          notes:
          - Homomorphisms are distinct from isomorphisms in that no inverse function
            is required. In an isomorphism, there are essentially two homomorphisms
            that are functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are
            topological homomorphisms because they preserve "topological characteristics."
            The mapping of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves
            the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
