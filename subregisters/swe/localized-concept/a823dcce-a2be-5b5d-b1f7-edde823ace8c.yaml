          notes:
          - The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate
            the limits of the surface. Surfaces that are isomorphic to a sphere, or
            to an n-torus (a topological sphere with n "handles") have no boundary.
            Such surfaces are called cycles.
