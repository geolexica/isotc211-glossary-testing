          - A condominium unit comprising two spatial units (e.g. an apartment and
            a garage), a farm lot comprising one spatial unit (e.g. parcel of land),
            a servitude comprising one spatial unit (e.g. the road representing the
            right-of-way), a land consolidation area, or a right-of-use unit with
            several right holders and restricted objects.

          notes:
          - '''Unique'' means that a right, restriction, or responsibility is held
            by one or more parties (e.g. owners or users) for the whole basic administrative
            unit. ''Homogeneous'' means that a right, restriction or responsibility
            (e.g. ownership, use, social tenure, lease, or easement) affects the whole
            basic administrative unit. For a restriction, zero parties are a possibility.'
          - A basic administrative unit may play the role of party, e.g. when the
            right holder is a basic administrative unit (and not a person or organization).
          - A baunit should get a unique identifier when registered, or recorded.
          - A baunit can consist of zero spatial units, when a registry exists, and
            not a cadastre.
          - Restrictions and responsibilities can be associated with their own baunits,
            each with their own type of spatial unit.
