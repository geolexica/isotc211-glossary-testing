          notes:
          - The orientation of the directed edges that compose the exterior boundary
            of a directed face will appear positive from the direction of this vector;
            the orientation of a directed face that bounds a topological solid will
            point away from the topological solid. Adjacent solids would use different
            orientations for their shared boundary, consistent with the same sort
            of association between adjacent faces and their shared edges. Directed
            faces are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association
            between face and edge.
