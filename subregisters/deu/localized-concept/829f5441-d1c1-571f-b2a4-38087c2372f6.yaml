          - A data quality scope for a dataset can comprise a dataset series to which
            the dataset belongs, the dataset itself, or a smaller grouping of data
            located physically within the dataset sharing common characteristics.
            Common characteristics can be an identified feature type, feature attribute,
            or feature relationship; data collection criteria; original source; or
            a specified geographic or temporal extent.
