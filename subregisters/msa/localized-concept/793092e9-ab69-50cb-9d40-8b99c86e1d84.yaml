          notes:
          - A reference can be a measurement unit, a measurement procedure, a reference
            material, or a combination of such.
          - Symbols for quantities are given in the ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 series
            Quantities and units. The symbols for quantities are written in italics.
            A given symbol can indicate different quantities.
          - A quantity as defined here is a scalar. However, a vector or a tensor,
            the components of which are quantities, is also considered to be a quantity.
          - The concept "quantity" may be generically divided into, e.g. "physical
            quantity", "chemical quantity", and "biological quantity", or "base quantity"
            and "derived quantity".
