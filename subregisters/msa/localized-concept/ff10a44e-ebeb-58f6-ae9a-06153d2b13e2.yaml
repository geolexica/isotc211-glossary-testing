          notes:
          - A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some
            constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically
            within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be as small as a
            single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset.
            A hardcopy map or chart may be considered a dataset.
