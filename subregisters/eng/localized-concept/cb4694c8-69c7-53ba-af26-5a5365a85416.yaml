          definition: SAR mode in which the antenna beam is steered to illuminate
            a swath of ground at various angles relative to flight path throughout
            the collection

          notes:
          - Steering the antenna also allows dwell time to be increased and provides
            the ability to collect strips at angles non-parallel to the flight direction
            and with better resolution than Stripmap mode.
