          notes:
          - For PolSAR sensor, if the transmitting channel is horizontally (H) polarized,
            the cross-talk on transmitting defines the ratio of V polarization transmitting
            power to H polarization transmitting power, expressed in decibels (dB).
            The cross-talk on receiving is similar to that on transmitting.
