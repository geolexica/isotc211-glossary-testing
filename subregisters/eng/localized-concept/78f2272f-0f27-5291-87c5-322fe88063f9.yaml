          notes:
          - Point and DirectPosition are informationally identical (related to each
            other in a one to one fashion) in this context. Given a DirectPosition,
            a Point can be constructed. Given a Point, a DirectPosition can be derived
            from of its coordinates. If coercion is supported, a Point may be used
            where a DirectPosition is requested, and vice versa. Most programming
            languages use coercion, but others use "cast" operators (a type of constructor)
            requiring the programmer to initiate the coercion. "Strong substantiality"
            is related in that a subtype instance can always be coerced to any of
            its supertypes.
