          - The mail recipient is normally the addressee, the mailee or an authorized
            representative of one of these two. However, this might not always be
            the case, e.g. if the postal item is left for collection in a location
            to which third parties have access; if the addressee/mailee have moved
            without leaving forwarding instructions or if the addressee or mailee
            specification was ambiguous and was, as a result, misinterpreted by the
            postal operator
