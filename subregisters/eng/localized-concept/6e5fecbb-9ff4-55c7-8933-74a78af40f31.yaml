          - \[[\forall a \in A \implies max(A) \geq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b
            \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \geq a] \implies [max(a) \leq b]]\] Any
            number is an upper bound of `O/` (empty set) as a set of numbers, because
            any given number is greater than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous
            statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This
            means that the `max(O/)` must be smaller than any number; thus `-oo`.
