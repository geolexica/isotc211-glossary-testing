          - 'Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three
            attributes:  — a focus on the preservation of the full information content
            that needs preservation; —  a perspective that the new archival implementation
            of the information is a replacement for the old; —  an understanding that
            full control and responsibility over all aspects of the transfer resides
            with the OAIS.'
