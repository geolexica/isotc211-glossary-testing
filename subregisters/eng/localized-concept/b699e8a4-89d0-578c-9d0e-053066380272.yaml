          definition: coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
            reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system
            in which both coordinate reference systems are based on the same datum
          entry_status: valid
          examples:
          - A mapping of ellipsoidal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using a
            map projection.
          - Change of units such as from radians to degrees or from feet to metres.

          language_code: eng
          notes:
          - A coordinate conversion uses parameters which have specified values.
