          notes:
          - For example, with aerial mapping cameras, there are lever arms between
            the inertial centre of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the phase
            centre of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna, each
            with respect to the camera perspective centre within the lens of the camera.
