          notes:
          - If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (`bbb"E"^3`),
            and `s` is the arc length along `c(s)`, then the unit tangent vector is
            `dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative of the
            coordinate values of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector is
            `ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`. The curvature vector
            can be approximated by the inverse of the radius of a circle through any
            3 nearby points on the curve (pointed from the curve to towards the centre
            of the circle)
