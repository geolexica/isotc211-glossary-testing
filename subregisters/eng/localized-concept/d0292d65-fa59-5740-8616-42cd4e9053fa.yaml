          definition: property of a geometric object implying that any two direct
            positions on the object can be placed on a curve that remains totally
            within the object

          notes:
          - A topological object is connected if and only if all its geometric realizations
            are connected. This is not included as a definition because it follows
            from a theorem of topology.
