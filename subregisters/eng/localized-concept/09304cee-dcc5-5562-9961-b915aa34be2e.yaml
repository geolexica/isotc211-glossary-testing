          notes:
          - The coordinate dimension represents the number of choices made, and constraints
            can restrict choices. A barycentric coordinate which has (n+1)-offsets,
            but the underlying space is dimension n. Homogeneous coordinates (wx,
            wy, wz, w) are actually 3 dimensional because the choice of "w" does not
            affect the position, i.e. (wx, wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) → (x, y, z) which
            is not affected by w. The dimension will be at most the count of the numbers
            in the coordinate, but it can be less if the coordinates are constrained
            in some manner.asie
