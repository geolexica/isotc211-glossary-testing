          notes:
          - While the identifiers of these features or objects can sometimes identify
            a place, within the scope of this document, the identifiers of features
            or objects existing in other encoding domains are referred to conceptually
            as "other identifiers".
          - These "other identifiers" can exist outside of the PI architecture.
