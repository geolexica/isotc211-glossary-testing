          notes:
          - For the Earth the rotation is about the polar axis. This results in an
            oblate ellipsoid with midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre
            of the Earth.
          - The two usual algorithms for latitude on an ellipsoid and on a sphere
            (such as used in spherical coordinates) are only equivalent if the ellipsoid
            is a sphere, having all radii equal in all directions. The problem is
            that a radial line from the centre of a general ellipsoid does not always
            cross the surface of the ellipsoid orthogonally. In general, planar slices
            through the centre do not intersect the surface orthogonally, and therefore
            the curves that correspond to the great circles of a sphere are not geodesics
            on the ellipsoid.
          - The topology of the ellipsoid is inherited from the ùîº3 space in which
            it is embedded. The difference is that metrics such as distance and direction
            on the ellipsoid are restricted to curves wholly on the surface and vectors
            tangent to the surface.at
