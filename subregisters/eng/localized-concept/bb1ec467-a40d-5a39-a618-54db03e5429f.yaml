          definition: system consisting of 1) a photon source (frequently, but not
            necessarily, a laser), 2) a photon detection system, 3) a timing circuit,
            and 4) optics for both the source and the receiver that uses emitted laser
            light to measure ranges to and/or properties of solid objects, gases,
            or particulates in the atmosphere

          notes:
          - Time of flight (TOF) LIDARs use short laser pulses and precisely record
            the time each laser pulse was emitted and the time each reflected return(s)
            is received in order to calculate the distance(s) to the scatterer(s)
            encountered by the emitted pulse. For topographic LIDAR, these time-of-flight
            measurements are then combined with precise platform location/attitude
            data along with pointing data to produce a three-dimensional product of
            the illuminated scene of interest.
