          definition: groups of signal samples in a SAR processor that splits the
            full synthetic aperture into several subapertures, each representing an
            independent look of the identical scene

          - The resulting image formed by incoherent summing of these looks is characterized
            by reduced speckle and degraded spatial resolution.
