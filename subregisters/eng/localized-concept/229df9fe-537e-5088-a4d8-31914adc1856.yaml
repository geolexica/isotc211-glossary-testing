          notes:
          - '"Smallest" is the set theoretic smallest, not an indication of a measurement.
            The definition can be rewritten as "the intersection of all convex sets
            that contain the geometric object". Another definition in a Euclidean
            space `bbb"E"^n` is the union of all lines with both end points in the
            given geometric object. `C = A."convexHull" <=> [C."convex" = "TRUE"]
            ^^ [A sub C] ^^ [[B."convex" = "true", A sub B] => [A sube C sube B]]`'
