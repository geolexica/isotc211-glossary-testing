          notes:
          - An interface specifies a contract; any classifier that realizes the interface
            must fulfil that contract. The obligations that can be associated with
            an interface are in the form of various kinds of constraints (such as
            pre- and post-conditions) or protocol specifications, which can impose
            ordering restrictions on interactions through the interface.
