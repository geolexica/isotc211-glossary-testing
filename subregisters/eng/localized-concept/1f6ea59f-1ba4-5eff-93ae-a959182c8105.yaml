          notes:
          - The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve.
            If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if
            topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first
            point is called the start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity
            of the curve is guaranteed by the "continuous image of a line" clause.
            A topological theorem states that a continuous image of a connected set
            is connected.
