          definition: information that maps a data object into more meaningful concepts
          entry_status: valid
          examples:
          - Representation information for a bit sequence which is a FITS file might
            consist of the FITS standard which defines the format plus a dictionary
            which defines the meaning in the file of keywords which are not part of
            the standard.
          - JPEG software which is used to render a JPEG file; rendering the JPEG
            file as bits is not very meaningful to humans but the software, which
            embodies an understanding of the JPEG standard, maps the bits into pixels
            which can then be rendered as an image for human viewing.
