          notes:
          - The RDF namespace is concatenated with the localName to create the complete
            URI identifier for an RDF resource. Every RDF resource is identified by
            a URI. In contrast, an XML namespace URI scopes a local XML component
            name, but there is no rule for combining these into a single identifier
            string.
