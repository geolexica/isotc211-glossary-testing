          definition: distance measure on a ùîºn coordinate space using a root-mean
            sum of the differences between the individual coordinate offsets

            The proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local "flatness"
            of the space. Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean metrics
            are called Euclidean spaces (`bbb"E"^n`). In the realm of coordinate reference
            systems, only "Engineering Coordinate Systems" are Euclidean. Any CRS
            using a curved Datum are by definition non-Euclidean, and cannot "truthfully"
            use Pythagorean metrics except for approximation. These approximations
            are valid for topological statements, but not for real world measures
            without adjustments.'
