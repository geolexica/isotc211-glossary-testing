          - The usual construction begins by choosing one of the end points, the normal
            to the surface at that end point, and the location of the other end point
            and creating a plane in ùîº3, which is then intersected with the datum.
            This curve is a normal section curve between these two points, containing
            the normal to the surface at the first point. On the sphere, this is the
            geodesic, and the two normal section curves are equal. On an ellipsoidal
            datum, the same is true for two points on the equator, or two points on
            the same meridian plane, but false in general. The reason is that in these
            cases the plane through the two points and the centre of the ellipsoid
            are planes of symmetry for the ellipsoid dividing the ellipsoid into symmetric
            "mirror" image halves. In general, the geodesic between the two points
            lies between the two normal section curves.in th
