          definition: coordinate reference system for the positions in a grid that
            uses a defined coordinate system congruent with the coordinate system
            described by the GridEnvelope and axisLabels of gml:GridType

          notes:
          - A grid CRS uses a defined coordinate system with the same grid point positions
            and origin as the GridEnvelope, with the same axisLabels, but need not
            define any limits on the grid size. This coordinate system is sometimes
            called the internal grid coordinate system.
