          notes:
          - DTMs are comprised of mass points and breaklines that are irregularly
            spaced to better characterize the true shape of the bare-earth terrain.
            The net result of DTMs is that the distinctive terrain features are more
            clearly defined and precisely located, and contours generated from DTMs
            more closely approximate the real shape of the terrain.
