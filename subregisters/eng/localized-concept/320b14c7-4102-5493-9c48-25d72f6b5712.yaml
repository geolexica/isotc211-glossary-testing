          definition: visual effect in SAR images of ambiguity among returns from
            scatterers at different heights that fall into the same range-Doppler-time
            bin

          notes:
          - The effect makes buildings “lay over” onto the ground toward the sensor
            velocity vector, akin to perspective views in projective imagery.
