          notes:
          - Boundary faces are used when the implied vertical and unbounded faces
            of a boundary face string are not sufficient to describe 3D spatial units.
            Boundary faces close volumes in height (e.g. every apartment floor), or
            in depth (e.g. an underground parking garage), or in all other directions
            to form a bounded volume. The volumes represent legal space (in contrast
            with physical space).
