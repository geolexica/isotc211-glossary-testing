          definition: coordinate reference system that is defined through the application
            of a specified coordinate conversion to the coordinates within a previously
            established coordinate reference system

          notes:
          - The previously established coordinate reference system is referred to
            as the base coordinate reference system.
          - A derived coordinate reference system inherits its datum or reference
            frame from its base coordinate reference system.
          - The coordinate conversion between the base and derived coordinate reference
            system is implemented using the parameters and formula(s) specified in
            the definition of the coordinate conversion.
