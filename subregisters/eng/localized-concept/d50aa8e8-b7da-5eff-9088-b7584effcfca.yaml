          definition: gridded data whose attribute values describe characteristics
            of a grid coverage feature in a grid format

          notes:
          - Most gridded thematic data are derived from imagery (4.12) data using
            geophysical/atmospheric inversion algorithms. Gridded thematic data may
            also be obtained from other sources such as digitization of topographic
            map sheets.
