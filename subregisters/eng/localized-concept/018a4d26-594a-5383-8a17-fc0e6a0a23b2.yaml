          definition: effect that causes a vessel moving through water to create an
            area of lowered pressure under its bottom that increases the effective
            draught (i.e. lowers the vessel in the water)

          notes:
          - The effect is a result of Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics. The
            squat represents the increase in effective draught.
          - For a ship underway, the change of level of the bow and stern from the
            still water condition in response to the elevation and depression of the
            water level about the hull resulting from the bow and stern wave systems.
