          notes:
          - Directed solids are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial
            association between face and topological solid. The orientation of a solid
            is with respect to a face, "+" if the upNormal is outward, "-" if inward.
            This is consistent with the concept of "up = outward" for a surface bounding
            a solid.
